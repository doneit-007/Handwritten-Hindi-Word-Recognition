SOME INFO ABOUT FILES-

main.py- contains two function test and predict ,predict function returns list of characters

all_functions_used.py - it contains all the necessary preprocessing functions used for processing image

character.txt- it contains charcterset on which model was trained

model.h5- ML model which was trained for predicting character 

requirements.txt- contains versions of all the libraries and packages required for running the file  

prediction_test_images-contains test images on which model was successful in predicting correct word

segmentation_test_images-contains images on which script was successful in segmentation


STEPS FOR RUNNING-

just give the correct model path and run the main.py


Features of our model-

1.It can handle rotated word, angle<80degree
2.It can work on blurry images
3.It can work on images with shadows and background noises
4.The only necessary condition for model to work is slight space between characters
5.Size of character set is 21
